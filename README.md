**Hello!**

This repo is for STAT850 Homework 10: Professional Communication.

Here is my slides: [one](https://github.com/Dada-Z/stat-slide-cv.github.io/blob/main/part1_beamer.pdf) used beamer/LaTeX and [one](part1_html.html) was HTML-based(reveal.js).

Here is my [CV](https://github.com/Dada-Z/stat-slide-cv.github.io/blob/main/cvDZ.pdf). 

- The bib does not work when compile pdf using main tex file. To solve this issue, execute the following commands in Terminal: 

- pdflatex cvDZ.tex 
- biber cvDZ 
- pdflatex cvDZ.tex

P.s. I first worked on all files in the "10-professional-Dada-Z" repo (private), then moved the necessary files here and generated the final output.
