## Introduction

\textcolor{blue}{Hello!}

My name is **Dada Zhang**, and my birthday is July 23. I grew up in a small town called Yitong in northeast China. After finishing high school, I began university studies in Huanghua City in Hebei Province. I initially majored in Civil Engineering, and after my first year, I became an exchange student and studied Construction Management and Mathematics at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona. Upon completing my bachelor's degrees, I pursued master's degrees in Statistics and Civil Engineering, finishing my dissertation in 2021. In 2022, I began my Ph.D. in Construction Engineering and Management at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.

Having spent many years in academia, I often get asked, **"When do you graduate?"** I expect to complete my Ph.D. in 2026 and would like to work in academia after graduation.

## Favorite Animal

This is my favorite animal (Figure \ref{fig:panda}) â€” the Panda. Her name is Huahua, and she is the top star in pandas!

```{=tex}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{./panda_huahua.jpg}
  \caption{Huahua panda.}
  \label{fig:panda}
\end{figure}
```
## Favorite Plot

I created different plots in the class, and here is my favorite plot that I generated before. I loved this because it was a nice visualization.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 3}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
# Week 05: Cookies dataset
cookie <- read.csv("./choc_chip_cookie_ingredients.csv")
recipe_count <- n_distinct(cookie$Recipe_Index)
# Q4. Which ingredients are most frequently used in the cookie dataset? 
## using bar chart
cookie %>% 
  group_by(Ingredient) %>%
  summarise(uniq_recipe_cnt = n_distinct(Recipe_Index)) %>%
  mutate(proportion = uniq_recipe_cnt / recipe_count) %>%
  arrange(desc(proportion)) %>%
  head(20) %>%
  # plot data
  # adjust x-axis: show in descendig order
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(Ingredient, -uniq_recipe_cnt), y = uniq_recipe_cnt)) +
  geom_col(fill = "skyblue3") +
  labs(title = "The most common 20 Ingredients in Cookie Recipes (Week 5 Cookie Dataset)",
       x = "Ingredient",
       y = "Number of Recipes") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 8))
```
